# CafRate
CafRate is a program for viewing the St. Olaf dialy menu, reading reviews, and leaving reviews for others.

# Note:
* This program was written as a collaborative project between myself, Dagmawe Haileslassie, and Erica Meyers. It has been posted here with their permission.
* CafRate was written for use with a proprietary web server at St. Olaf college. The code will not run off campus without heavy tweaking.
* Cafrate is written mostly in C++ with the UI in YAML and communication with a webserver in python.
